# codesters-graphics
A library to allow programs developed on codesters.com to run offline.

## Synopsis

This is a python module to allow students working on www.codesters.com to run codesters projects offline.
The codesters-graphics library is also a great way to segue from structured lessons on codesters.com to
larger, object-oriented projects.

## Code Example

You can install the codesters library with pip.
```
pip install codesters
```
You can run a python file with the codesters graphics library like this:
```
codesters my_project_file.py
```

## Motivation

Codesters.com is a great way for a teacher to easily lead a class through lessons teaching Python programming via
interactive games and animations. The web based coding platform on codesters.com exposes a library of graphics,
animation, and game design tools that are not included with a basic Python installation. The codesters-graphics
project provides a similar graphical environment to allow a project created on codesters.com to be run in an
offline Python installation.

We at Codesters received requests from teachers who enjoyed working through lessons on codesters.com but wanted
to introduce students to working with a filesystem or working with other open source python modules within a
codesters project. The codesters-graphics library allows this transition.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
